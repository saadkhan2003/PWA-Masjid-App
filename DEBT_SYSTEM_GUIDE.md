# 🏛️ Mosque Committee Debt Management System

## Overview

The Mosque Committee PWA now includes a comprehensive automatic debt management system that handles monthly dues collection for all members. This system automatically generates monthly debts, tracks payments, and manages outstanding balances.

## 🚀 Key Features

### Automatic Monthly Debt Generation
- **Rs 200 Default Monthly Dues**: Every member automatically gets Rs 200 debt each month
- **Historical Debt Generation**: When adding new members, debts are created from their join date to current month
- **Accumulating Debts**: Unpaid monthly dues accumulate over time (e.g., 3 months unpaid = Rs 600 total debt)
- **Overdue Management**: Debts automatically get marked as overdue when past due date

### Smart Payment Processing
- **Oldest First**: When members pay, their oldest debts are cleared first
- **Partial Payments**: Supports partial payments with automatic remaining debt calculation
- **Real-time Updates**: Member total debt is updated automatically after each payment
- **Receipt Tracking**: All payments are tracked with receipt numbers and dates

### Real Data Integration
- **No Mock Data**: All tabs and screens now show actual database data
- **Live Calculations**: Debt totals are calculated from actual pending debts
- **Automatic Synchronization**: Online/offline data sync with automatic updates

## 📋 How to Set Up the System

### 1. Initial Setup (One-time)
1. Navigate to **Debt System** in the main menu
2. Click **"Initialize Debt System"** button
3. This will generate historical debts for all existing members from their join date

### 2. Adding New Members
- When adding a new member, monthly dues default to Rs 200
- Historical debts are automatically generated from join date to current month
- Total debt is calculated and displayed immediately

### 3. Monthly Automation
- Use **"Run Full Debt Automation"** to:
  - Generate current month's debts for all active members
  - Update overdue status for past-due debts
  - Refresh all member debt totals
- Recommended: Set up monthly automation on the 1st of each month

## 💰 How the Debt System Works

### Monthly Debt Cycle
```
Member joins → Historical debts generated → Monthly debts auto-created → Payments reduce debts → Overdue tracking
```

### Example Scenario

- **Total Debt: Rs 800**

**After Payment of Rs 300:**
- January 2024: Rs 200 (paid) ✅
- February 2024: Rs 100 (paid) ✅
- February 2024: Rs 100 (remaining - pending)
