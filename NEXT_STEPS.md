# Database Schema Fix & Completion Guide

## IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED: Database Schema Fix

The main blocker preventing payment and debt creation is **missing database columns**. You must execute the SQL script in your Supabase dashboard to fix this.

### Step 1: Execute Database Schema Fix

1. **Open your Supabase Dashboard**
2. **Go to SQL Editor**
3. **Copy and paste the contents of `complete-schema-fix.sql`** into the SQL Editor
4. **Run the script**

This will add the missing `month`, `year`, and `type` columns to your database tables.

### Step 2: Verify Database Schema

After running the schema fix, execute the `verify-database.sql` script to confirm everything is working:

1. **In Supabase SQL Editor**
2. **Copy and paste the contents of `verify-database.sql`**
3. **Run the verification script**
4. **Check that all columns show "‚úì exists"**
